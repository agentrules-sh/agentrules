description: One command to install a preset.

Install any preset with a single command:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli add <preset-name> --platform <platform>
```

For example:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli add agentic-dev-starter --platform opencode
```

That's it. Files are copied to your project's platform directory (`.opencode/`, `.claude/`, etc.) and they're yours to customize.

## Finding Presets

Browse [agentrules.directory](https://agentrules.directory) to discover presets. Each preset page shows:

- What files are included
- A ready-to-copy install command
- The platform it's designed for

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Directory |
|----------|-----------|
| OpenCode | `.opencode/` |
| Claude Code | `.claude/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/` |
| Codex | `.codex/` |

## Next Steps

The files are now yours. Edit them, remove what you don't need, and evolve them as your workflow changes.
