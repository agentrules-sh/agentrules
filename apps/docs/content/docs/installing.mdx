description: One command to install a rule.
---

Install any rule with a single command:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli add <name> --platform <platform>
```

For example:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli add agentic-dev-starter --platform opencode
```

That's it. Files are copied to your project's platform directory (`.opencode/`, `.claude/`, etc.) and they're yours to customize.

## Finding Rules

Browse [agentrules.directory](https://agentrules.directory) to discover rules. Each page shows:

- What files are included
- A ready-to-copy install command
- The platform it's designed for

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | ID | Directory |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `.opencode/` |
| Claude Code | `claude` | `.claude/` |
| Cursor | `cursor` | `.cursor/` |
| Codex | `codex` | `.codex/` |

## Global Install

By default, rules install to your current project. Use `-g` or `--global` to install to your global config directory:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli add agentic-dev-starter --platform opencode --global
```

| Platform | Project | Global |
|----------|---------|--------|
| OpenCode | `.opencode/` | `~/.config/opencode` |
| Claude | `.claude/` | `~/.claude` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/` | `~/.cursor` |
| Codex | `.codex/` | `~/.codex` |

## Next Steps

The files are now yours. Edit them, remove what you don't need, and evolve them as your workflow changes.
