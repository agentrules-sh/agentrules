Rules are bundles of configuration files copied into your project.

## Why Publish?

- **Showcase your setup** — All your rules on your personal profile page
- **Reach developers** — Put your work in front of developers browsing for rules
- **Get featured** — Popular rules appear in trending and get more visibility
- **Drop your links** — Users see your custom message on install (tips, links, whatever you want)

## How to Publish

Already have a repo with your rule files? Three commands:

### 1. Initialize

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli init
```

Run this in the directory you want to publish (the same directory that will contain `agentrules.json`).

### 2. Login

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli login
```

Opens a browser for authentication.

### 3. Publish

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli publish
```

Your rule is now live.

## Quick Publish

Don't have an `agentrules.json`? Publish directly — the CLI prompts for what it needs:

```bash
# Publish a file or directory (interactive)
npx @agentrules/cli publish .claude/commands/deploy.md
npx @agentrules/cli publish ./my-rule

# Non-interactive (requires all options)
npx @agentrules/cli publish .claude/commands/deploy.md --platform claude --type command --name deploy
```

After publishing, you'll be prompted to create an `agentrules.json` for future publishes.

Use `--dry-run` to preview before publishing.

## What Gets Published

Everything in your rule directory becomes your rule (except config + metadata):

```
my-rule/
├── agentrules.json    <- Config (not included)
├── README.md          <- Metadata (not bundled)
├── LICENSE.md         <- Metadata (not bundled; LICENSE.txt also supported)
├── INSTALL.txt        <- Metadata (not bundled)
├── AGENTS.md          <- Included (optional)
└── command/
    └── review.md      <- Included
```

## Updating

Made changes? Just publish again:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli publish
```

The version auto-increments. Users installing your rule get your latest changes.
