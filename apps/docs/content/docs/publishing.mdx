## Why Publish?

- **Showcase your setup** — All your presets on your personal profile page
- **Reach developers** — Put your work in front of developers browsing for presets
- **Get featured** — Popular presets appear in trending and get more visibility
- **Drop your links** — Users see your custom message on install (tips, links, whatever you want)

## How to Publish

Already have configurations in `.opencode/`, `.claude/`, or another platform directory? Three commands:

### 1. Initialize

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli init
```

Run this inside your platform directory. It creates `agentrules.json` with your preset's metadata (name, description, license).

### 2. Login

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli login
```

Opens a browser for authentication.

### 3. Publish

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli publish
```

Your preset is now live.

## What Gets Published

Everything in your platform directory becomes your preset:

```
.opencode/
├── agentrules.json    ← Config (not included in preset)
├── AGENTS.md          ← Included
├── commands/          ← Included
│   └── review.md
└── .agentrules/       ← Metadata for registry (not included)
    └── README.md
```

## Updating

Made changes? Just publish again:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli publish
```

The version auto-increments. Users installing your preset get your latest changes.
