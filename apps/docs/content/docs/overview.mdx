## What is Agent Rules?

Agent Rules is a package manager for AI coding assistant configurations. It lets you:

- **Install** community presets to quickly set up your AI tools
- **Publish** your own configurations to share with others
- **Discover** workflows for tools like OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex

### Presets vs Rules

**Presets** are bundles of configuration files — agents, commands, instructions, and tools packaged together. Install a preset to get a complete setup.

**Rules** are single files — one agent, one command, or one instruction. Install a rule when you just need that one piece.

Both are installed the same way:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli add <name> --platform <platform>
```
