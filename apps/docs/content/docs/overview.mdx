## What is Agent Rules?

Agent Rules is a package manager for AI coding assistant configurations. It lets you:

- **Install** community rules to quickly set up your AI tools
- **Publish** your own configurations to share with others
- **Discover** workflows for tools like OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex

### Rules

Rules are bundles of configuration files — agents, commands, instructions, and tools packaged together. Install a rule to get a complete setup.

Rules are installed with `add`:

```bash
npx @agentrules/cli add <name> --platform <platform>
```
